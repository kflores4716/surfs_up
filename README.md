## Overview of Analysis 

The primary purpose of this analysis is to gather weather data from the island of O’ahu, HI to help find the best spot to open a surf and ice cream shop. Along with a friend, W. Avy, we are trying to get investors for this new business venture. Although we already have a good feeling about opening the shop somewhere on O’ahu, we still need to make sure the investors are on board with the plan and will be willing to support us in our journey to open our first shop. We are providing an analysis of the weather on the island in both June and December that will help our pitch to the investors. With data from both summertime and winter, we can prove to them that the weather is suitable enough for a surf and ice cream shop to profitably operate year-round.  


## Results 

After gathering the proper data and running our analyses, we created tables containing summary statistics for June and December. We found that although there are differences in temperature between the two months, those differences are pretty marginal. See below for images of the summary statistics tables: 

#### June Temperature Stats

#### December Temperature Stats

There are a few points to note when looking at these two sets of statistics: 

- The average temperature in June is about 75 degrees, while the average temperature in December is about 71 degrees. Clearly, it is colder in December than in June, however, it is only colder by an average of 4 degrees, and the average temperature is still over 70. 

- The maximum temperatures for June and December are 85 degrees and 83 degrees respectively, so it can get almost equally as hot in the winter as in the summer. The minimum temperatures are 64 degrees and 56 degrees respectively, so it can get colder during the winter (as is expected). 

- The mean and median (the “50%” row) for both June and December are essentially equal. This symmetrical distribution gives us a hint that although the weather can fluctuate between the max and min temperatures, it remains pretty consistent overall.  


## Summary 

The summary statistics listed above show us that there are some differences in temperature between June and December. However, those differences aren’t drastic enough to prove to us that a surfing and ice cream shop cannot operate year-round.  

With an average temperature in December of 71 degrees, only 4 degrees lower than that of June, O’ahu should still be (on average) warm enough for surfing and/or ice cream eating in the winter. The island can get down into the 50s in December which likely is too cold to surf for most people (and perhaps too cold for ice cream), but that doesn’t seem to happen very often.  

Because the mean and median are equal for both months, we know that the weather doesn’t fluctuate too much. This also tells us that around 50% of the days in December have a temperature greater than or equal to 71 degrees, which should be plenty warm for surfing and ice cream.  

In addition to analyzing the temperature data for June and December, it would also be helpful to look at precipitation data for the two months. Precipitation brings overcast skies, and without an exposed sun to warm the air, the weather can become slightly less bearable in the winter. So, to get an even better idea of how conducive the island’s weather is for surfing and ice cream, we ran additional analyses. Below are summary statistics of precipitation data for June and December:

#### December Precipitation Stats

This precipitation data provides a better understanding of what the weather is like on O’ahu year-round. For surfing especially, looking at how often it rains will help prove or refute that the island caters to surfers throughout the whole year. If it were to rain all the time (especially in the winter), the island would be less surfer friendly. For the ice cream side of things, rain wouldn’t matter too much because you can always eat ice cream inside. Ultimately, taking precipitation into account would be wise, especially in the winter, because rainy conditions not only mean wet conditions, but they also make for overcast skies that will block out the sun's warming rays.
